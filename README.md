# Airbnb Rental Price Prediction

**Description**

This repository includes my code for the Kaggle competition on predicting Airbnb rental prices. The goal of the project was to be able to predict Airbnb rental prices according to various metrics such as the property location, size, rating, amenities etc. While over 10 models with various machine learning methods were built for this competition, including Regression Tree, Random Forest, and cvBoosting, this repository only contains the files for the best performing model (XGBoost). 

**Files**
1. "Model10_XGBoost" R file: Code for the XGBoost model implemented
2. "Model10 XGBoost" CSV file: Predicted prices for each property in the test dataset as generated from previous R file
3. "Phoebe Chen - Kaggle Report" PDF file: Written report regarding comparisons of models that were built for this project
